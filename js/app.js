// 1) Define any variables used to track the state of the game:
//    The players choice
//    Current round data
//          Chioices
//          Correct answer
//          Question
//    The match result - win/lose
//    A result message - display who won that round

// 2) Define the required constants:
//    There are only 3 choices a user can make, create buttons
//    We'll need a reference to a DOM element to display masseges for both questions and answers

// 3) Handle a player clicking a choice button

// 4) Handle generating random selections for the computer player

// 5) Compare the player choice to the computer choice, and check for a winner

// 6) Render a win/lose message to the player 
//    Include both player and computer selections in the message
//    Clearly indicate who won
