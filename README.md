# Project Description
My app is called Trivia Time. It’s a trivia app where users can answer multiple-choice questions and see their score at the end. The app will present three questions, each with four possible answers. Users will select an answer for each question, and at the end of the quiz, the app will display the user’s score along with the correct answers. In the future, I’d like to add a feature where users can add their own questions and share quizzes with friends.
```javascript
let questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the capital of France?",
    options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
    correctAnswer: "Paris"
  },
  {
    question: "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
    options: ["Earth", "Jupiter", "Mars", "Saturn"],
    correctAnswer: "Mars"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the largest mammal?",
    options: ["Elephant", "Blue Whale", "Giraffe", "Human"],
    correctAnswer: "Blue Whale"
  }
];
```
MVP Goals
* As a user, I want to see a list of trivia questions so that I can test my knowledge.
* As a user, I want to select an answer for each question so that I can participate in the quiz.
* As a user, I want to see my score at the end of the quiz so that I know how well I did.
